For example, if we set the videomode \"r1024x768x60\" in\nthe firmware, Linux would incorrectly set a videomode with refresh rate\n180Hz when booting (suprisingly, my LCD monitor can display it, although\ndisplay quality is very low).\n\nThe reason is this: Older mach64 cards set the divider in the register\nVCLK_POST_DIV. The register has four 2-bit fields (the field that is\nactually used is specified in the lowest two bits of the register\nCLOCK_CNTL). The 2 bits select divider \"1, 2, 4, 8\". On newer mach64 cards,\nthere's another bit added - the top four bits of PLL_EXT_CNTL extend the\ndivider selection, so we have possible dividers \"1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 12\".\nThe Linux driver clears the top four bits of PLL_EXT_CNTL and never sets\nthem, so it can work regardless if the card supports them. However, the\nsparc64 firmware may set these extended dividers during boot - and the\nmach64 driver detects incorrect dot clock in this case.\n\nThis patch makes the driver read the additional divider bit from\nPLL_EXT_CNTL and calculate the initial refresh rate properly.\n\nSigned-off-by: Mikulas Patocka <mpatocka@redhat.com>\nCc: stable@vger.kernel.org\nAcked-by: David S.

The stack walker does\nhave guards against going completely off the rails and into random\nkernel memory, but it can interpret random data from your kernel stack\nas instruction pointers and stack pointers.  This can cause exposure of\nkernel stack contents to userspace.\n\nRestrict the ability to inspect kernel stacks of arbitrary tasks to root\nin order to prevent a local attacker from exploiting racy stack unwinding\nto leak kernel task stack contents.  See the added comment for a longer\nrationale.\n\nThere don't seem to be any users of this userspace API that can't\ngracefully bail out if reading from the file fails.

If we had a single PMD mapping of the page in mlocked VMA, the\npage will get mlocked, regardless of PTE mappings of the page.\n\nFor tmpfs/shmem it's easy to fix by checking PageDoubleMap() in\nremove_migration_pmd().\n\nAnon THP pages can only be shared between processes via fork().  Mlocked\npage can only be shared if parent mlocked it before forking, otherwise CoW\nwill be triggered on mlock().\n\nFor Anon-THP, we can fix the issue by munlocking the page on removing PTE\nmigration entry for the page.  PTEs for the page will always come after\nmlocked PMD: rmap walks VMAs from oldest to newest.\n\nTest-case:\n\n\t#include <unistd.h>\n\t#include <sys/mman.h>\n\t#include <sys/wait.h>\n\t#include <linux/mempolicy.h>\n\t#include <numaif.h>\n\n\tint main(void)\n\t{\n\t        unsigned long nodemask = 4;\n\t        void *addr;\n\n\t\taddr = mmap((void *)0x20000000UL, 2UL << 20, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE,\n\t\t\tMAP_PRIVATE | MAP_ANONYMOUS | MAP_LOCKED, -1, 0);\n\n\t        if (fork()) {\n\t\t\twait(NULL);\n\t\t\treturn 0;\n\t        }\n\n\t        mlock(addr, 4UL << 10);\n\t        mbind(addr, 2UL << 20, MPOL_PREFERRED | MPOL_F_RELATIVE_NODES,\n\t                &nodemask, 4, MPOL_MF_MOVE);\n\n\t        return 0;\n\t}\n\n[1] https://lkml.kernel.org/r/CAOMGZ=G52R-30rZvhGxEbkTw7rLLwBGadVYeo--iizcD3upL3A@mail.gmail.com\n\nLink: http://lkml.kernel.org/r/20180917133816.43995-1-kirill.shutemov@linux.intel.com\nFixes: 616b8371539a (\"mm: thp: enable thp migration in generic path\")\nSigned-off-by: Kirill A.
